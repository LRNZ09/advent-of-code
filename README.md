# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges, an annual event featuring programming puzzles released daily in December. It's an excellent opportunity to improve coding skills and problem-solving abilities.

## Structure

The solutions are organized by year and day. Each day has a folder named in the format `YYYY/day-DD`, containing code files and necessary resources.

### File Naming Convention

- **Input files**: `input.txt` (The specific input for each day's problem)
- **Solution files**: Varies based on language (e.g., `index.ts`, `main.dart`, etc.)

## Table of Contents

- [Year 2023](./2023/)
  - [Day #](./2023/day-#/)
    - [TypeScript solution](./2023/day-#/index.ts)
    - [Input file](./2023/day-#/input.txt)

- [Year 2022](./2022/)
  - [Day #](./2022/day-#/)
    - [Dart solution](./2022/lib/day_#/main.dart)
    - [Input file](./2022/day-#/input.txt)

## Usage

Feel free to explore the solutions and use them as a reference. To run any solution, ensure you have the necessary dependencies for the specific programming language installed.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are for educational purposes and personal reference. They may not be the most optimized or elegant solutions, but they solve the problems. Avoid copy-pasting solutions without understanding the logic behind them.
