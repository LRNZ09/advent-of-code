# Year 2022

This folder contains my Dart solutions for Advent of Code 2022 challenges, organized by day.

## Structure

- Solutions are in folders labeled by day (e.g., `day-01`) within the `lib` one.
- Each day includes Dart code files (`main.dart`, etc.) and an `input.txt` file.
- Unit tests are available within the `test` folder.

## Usage

Explore and use these solutions as references. Run them with Dart installed.

## Note

These solutions are educational; they might not be optimized. Understand the logic rather than blindly using it.

## Contributions

Contributions to improve or add new solutions are welcome!
